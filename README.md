# NIPS2018_Download
Download Papers and Supplementary of NIPS-2018

# Basic Functions
Download papers and supplementary materials from the pre-proceeding website, extract the possible zipfiles, combine the main.pdf and supp.pdf into one pdf file, rename the last file with the paper title.

There are two python3 files in the repo, "paper_download.py" uses the wget/urlopen to download file, which is a bit slow. "paper_download_IDM.py" uses the IDM which is faster (should replace the idman.exe file path in the program).
